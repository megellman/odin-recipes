            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 lb mascarpone cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 cup espresso</li>
            <li>2 T rum</li>
            <li>6 oz package ladyfingers</li>
            <li>1 T unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium saucepan until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
            <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture.</li>
            <li>Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9 x 9 in dish. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle cocoa powder over top.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
        </ol>
